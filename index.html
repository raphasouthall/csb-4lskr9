            Juliet champions and supports leaders to consistently be the best
            they can be. Acting as a catalyst for transformational moments along
            the leadership journey, she helps raise leaders to a level of
            brilliance perhaps even when they didn't realise it was possible

          <p>
            The combination of her 20 years as an agency practitioner, 20 years
            as a C-Suite level headhunter and her formal business coaching
            training gives her a unique ability to work alongside leaders,
            removing obstacles, unlocking ideas and helping define the way a
            leader wants to lead

          Juliet started her career at one of the most admired creative agencies
          in the world, BBH. She set up BBH's integrated agency in 1987 which
          she led for the next 14 years before moving into a growth role across
          the full agency group. In a high performance environment, she learnt
          about leadership and what it takes to be outstanding. It was this
          experience that prompted her move into headhunting. She joined Kendall
          Tarrant in 2003 where she challenged and inspired leaders from all
          over the world in the media, marketing and communications industries.
        </div>
        <div class="history">
          In 2007, she set up her own headhunting business with two partners.
          Grace Blue was founded on the belief that finding the right talent and
          supporting that talent was the most important factor positively
          impacting the success of any business. Grace Blue has grown to be a
          global organisation, respected all over the world for finding and
          developing transformational leadership talent.
        </div>
        <div class="history">
          Two decades later, she has now trained as a business coach with one of
          the most respected and exclusive business coaching programmes in the
          world - Meyler Campbell. This intensive training has enhanced her
          coaching skills and the knowledge of how to deliver the greatest
          impact. A member of Harvard's Institute of Coaching, she is part of a
          community of professional coaches who are constantly learning and
          sharing their knowledge and experience. Having stepped aside from her
          CEO role within Grace Blue, Juliet has now moved onto Grace Blue's
          global advisory board, leading their business coaching practice. Her
          experience of working with C-level executives provides her with a
          unique foundation to develop her clients effectively within their
          organisation environment.

          person better qualified to inspire and advise leaders"

          "I have been fortunate to work with Juliet for 17 years. During that
          time, as we have built the Grace Blue business around the world, I
          have seen first hand the extraordinary skills she brings to her work
          each and every day. Besides being a brilliant human being, there is an
          inherent kindness and genuine curiosity that comes with every
          engagement. She has a depth of experience of working with leaders that
          is second to none and I have consistently seen how she gains trust and
          builds the confidence of those she is working with and ultimately,
          enables them to be the very best version of themselves. I can't
          imagine anyone better suited to coach and advise those who are looking
          to be the leader they aspire to be."

          "Talented, well-rounded and ever hard-working, added to a winning and
          open personality... this has made Juliet both a very capable team
          leader and a builder of effective teams. She understands how teams
          operate harmoniously, whatever their size, their mix and their
          circumstances. She has been, unfailingly, a pleasure to work with, to
          know and to listen to. I cannot praise and endorse her highly enough."
